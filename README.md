# Servo Motor Project

#### Project Overview
The Servo Motor project showcases how to control a servo motor using an Arduino Mega. Servo motors are ideal for precise angular control, making them suitable for applications such as robotics, automation, and mechanical projects.

#### Components Needed
- **Arduino Mega**
- **Servo Motor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Servo Motor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal (SIG):** Connected to digital pin 9 on the Arduino Mega.
   - **Power (VCC) and Ground (GND):** Connected to 5V and GND on the Arduino Mega respectively.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

2. **Testing:**
   - The servo motor will sweep back and forth from 0 to 180 degrees and vice versa continuously.
   - Monitor the servo's movement and adjust the code for specific angular ranges or durations as needed.

#### Applications
- **Robotics:** Control robotic arms, grippers, and joints.
- **Automation:** Positioning mechanisms in automated systems.
- **Camera Control:** Pan and tilt functions in camera rigs.

#### Notes
- **Servo Library:** Utilizes the built-in Servo library for easy servo motor control.
- **Smooth Movement:** Delays are used to ensure smooth and gradual movement transitions.
- **Voltage Considerations:** Ensure the servo motor operates within its specified voltage range (typically 4.8V to 6V).
